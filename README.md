# bookr
This repo houses my work to create the sample bookr app, a Django app suggested as part of the book [Web Development with Django: Learn to build modern web applications with a Python-based framework](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57330076-web-development-with-django).

I do indeed realize the irony of creating an app called bookr and the linking to a goodreads entry. 

# Basic Rules

There is only one contributor here, myself. That being said, I'm establishing basic rules just in case anyone else comes in to add to this:
* Use a branching strategy. Don't push directly to main.
* Don't commit dead code or dead files. 
* Dockerize.
